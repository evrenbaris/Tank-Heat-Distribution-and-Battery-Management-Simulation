# Tank Heat Distribution and Battery Management Simulation

## Description
This project models and simulates the heat distribution and battery consumption in a tank system. It includes contributions from the motor, electronics systems, and environmental factors. The simulation visualizes heat generation over time and tracks battery levels as the system operates.

## Features
- Simulates heat generation from:
  - Motor (dynamic heat based on power).
  - Electronics (constant heat generation).
  - Environmental temperature (modeled as a sinusoidal effect).
- Calculates battery consumption over time.
- Provides clear visualizations for:
  - Heat distribution from all sources.
  - Battery depletion as the system operates.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
  - NumPy: Numerical computation.
  - Matplotlib: Visualization.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evrenbaris/tank-heat-battery-simulation.git
